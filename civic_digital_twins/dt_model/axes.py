    Parameters
    ----------
    name:
        Lower-case string; globally unique within an :class:`EvaluationResult`.
        Names starting with ``_`` are reserved for framework use (e.g.
        ``_ensemble`` for the default ENSEMBLE axis created by
        :class:`~civic_digital_twins.dt_model.simulation.ensemble.DistributionEnsemble`).
    role:
        One of the built-in constants :data:`DOMAIN`, :data:`PARAMETER`,
        :data:`ENSEMBLE`, or a user-defined UPPER_CASE string.

    Notes
    -----
    Equality and hashing are value-based on ``(name, role)``.  Two ``Axis``
    objects with the same *name* and *role* are equal regardless of identity.
    This allows ``Axis("time", DOMAIN)`` constructed at graph-build time to
    match the one in ``axis_layout`` constructed at evaluation time, which is
    required for ``output_axes`` comparisons in
    :meth:`~civic_digital_twins.dt_model.simulation.evaluation.EvaluationResult.expected_value`.
